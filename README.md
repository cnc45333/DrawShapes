# DrawShapes
This program was a project for CSCI 4810 at the University of Georgia. This program allows you to see 2D transformations.
Three sample files (polygon.txt, square.txt, and triangle.txt) are provided to test the program. 
The java file will ask for a .txt file that has provided coordinates for a shape in a matrix format. The program will then draw the shape.
After applying the desired transformations (translate, scale, rotate) the program asks for you to write the results to an output file. 
When opening the file, the original shape provided by the .txt file is outlined in black and the transformed shape will be outlined in blue.
